# Algo-THE3-Tester
Algorithms THE3 Tester

How to run?
1. Place your the3.cpp file in the same directory with the tester.
2. ~$ make clean
3. ~$ make all
4. ~$ make run
(or simply, ~$ make all)

I have also added the matrix generator I have used to generate the inputs. Feel free to make it more randomized.

DISCLAIMER:Tester does not measure your complexity. You may have bigger complexity than O(N^3) but tester will still count this correct. Also, you might have used a function that was not included in the original the3.h but it may work due to headers I have used in the tester.
